This folder contains three machine learning models on the three datasets which are the credit card fraud, customer churn and spam sms detection datasets. I have used different models like logistic regression model,
Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines to make a best model to perform on these datasets.
